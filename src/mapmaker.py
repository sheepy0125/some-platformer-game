# Duuuuck.
# This map maker is crap.
# Do not attempt to push this any more.
# You will not be able to.
# Why?
# Why do you like this horrible code?
# Why are you making another map maker when we have a perfectly functional map maker?
# Why does your code look like it was given to an AI and baked in the microwave?
# No.
